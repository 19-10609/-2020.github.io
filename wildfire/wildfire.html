                <h1 style="text-align: center;padding-top: 7%;">The Most Common Cause of Wildfires</h1><br>
                <p style="padding: 0% 15%;">Wildland fires are classified as either naturally occurring or human-caused. <br>
                According to the National Park Service, however, human-caused wildfires are <br>
                significantly more common, with human involvement triggering 85% to 90% of wildfires.
                </p><br>
                <p style="padding: 0% 15%;">
                    <b>For any fire to occur, there are three elements needed—heat, fuel, and oxygen:</b><br><br>

                            <b>-Heat.</b> There are many potential heat sources that can create embers and ignite wildfires. <br>
                            Many of these are human caused, which we will cover in more detail below. <br><br>
                            <b>-Fuel.</b> California’s arid climate and abundant, bone dry vegetation provides copious <br>
                            amounts of fuel for wildfires. <br><br>
                            <b>-Oxygen.</b> California’s infamous Santa Ana winds, dubbed “Diablo winds” by some locals,<br> 
                            produce gusts averaging 45-50 mph, with record gusts clocked at over 160 mph. <br> 
                            These winds fan the flames and spread embers, leading to truly devastating wildfires.

                There are three main cause of wildfires:

            Escaped embers from burning debris is one of the most common causes of wildfires. <br>
            On a particularly windy day, escaped embers can carry for miles without extinguishing.

            We typically associate campfires with beautiful memories, like s’mores and stories with loved ones. <br>
            However, despite a campfire’s summertime appeal, they are one of the leading causes of wildfires. <br>
            The Ham Lake Fire, which destroyed 75,000 acres and hundreds of properties, is just one example <br>
            of the devastation that a single campfire can cause. <br><br>
            If you plan on camping this year, always remember to practice proper fire safety. <br>
            Smokey Bear is an excellent resource for safety rules on building and extinguishing campfires.

        <p style="  display: flex;justify-content: center; font-size: 20px;">
            So, what causes a power line to spark or catch fire? The most common causes are weather-related <br>
            events that cause damage to lines and the equipment attached to them. Once damaged or downed, <br>
            wires may contact trees and other combustible materials resulting in sparks, smoke and fires. <br>
            Other causes include animal or human contact, equipment failures, and conductor slaps. A conductor <br>
            slap occurs when line conductors slap together creating a high-energy arc and ejecting hot metal <br>
            particles capable of starting fires.

            Climate change has been other key factor in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires. Wildfire risk depends <br>
            on a number of factors, including temperature, soil moisture, and the presence of trees, shrubs, and other <br>
            potential fuel. All these factors have strong direct or indirect ties to climate variability and climate change. <br>
            Research shows that changes in climate that create warmer, drier conditions, increased drought, and <br>
            a longer fire season are boosting these increases in wildfire risk.

            <p style="display: flex;justify-content: center;">
                In 2020, Australia was fighting one of its worst bushfire seasons, fuelled by record-breaking <br>
                temperatures and months of severe drought. It started on september 2019 and ended on <br>
                march 31. Bush and grass fires scorched 5.5 million hectares of land in New South Wales <br>  
                (NSW) alone, blackening an area that accounts for more than six percent of the state. <br>
                Within the southeastern state, fire destroyed a total of 2,448 homes and claimed 25 lives, <br>
                including three NSW Rural Fire Service volunteers and three US firefighters. These numbers <br>
                were unrivalled in the state’s history. Elsewhere, around the capital of Australia, <br>
                Canberra, trees are dying in their thousands with more marked for removal by the day. <br>
                Its crisis was one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history. The fires killed or <br>
                displaced nearly 3 billion animals. <br><br>
                Then what caused this catastrophe? Australia has always experienced bushfires - it has a<br>
                "fire season". But this year they are a lot worse than normal. Fires are usually caused by<br>
                lightning strikes or accidentally by a spark - but some fires are also started deliberately.<br>
                Of those, 13% are started deliberately, and 37% are suspicious. Also climate change contributed<br>
                to this disaster. This year a natural weather phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole<br>
                has meant a hot, dry spell across the country. But the overwhelming scientific consensus is<br>
                that rising levels of CO2 are warming the planet. And Australia has been getting hotter over<br>
                recent decades and is expected to continue doing so.This year, Australia twice set a new<br>
                temperature record: an average maximum of 41.9C was recorded on 18 December. That <br> 
                comes on top of a long period of drought.

                <p style="display: flex;justify-content: center; ">
                    The 2020 California wildfire season was characterized by a record-setting year of wildfires <br>
                    that burned across the state of California as measured during the modern era of wildfire <br>
                    management and record keeping. The season is a part of the 2020 Western United States <br>
                    wildfire season. As of the end of the year, 9,639 fires had burned 4,177,856 acres,more <br>
                    than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire <br>
                    season recorded in California's modern history, though roughly equivalent to the pre-1800 <br>
                    levels which averaged around 4.4 million acres yearly and up to 12 million in peak years. <br><br>
                    There are a few reasons why wildfires happended. Climate change is also the main reason of <br>
                    this disaster. Leading climate scientists argue that climate change increases the temperature <br>
                    of wildfires in California, the risk for drought, and potentially also the frequency of such <br>
                    events.[21][7] For example, David Romps, director of the Berkeley Atmospheric Sciences Center <br>
                    summarizes the situation as follows: "To cut to the chase: Were the heat wave and the lightning <br>
                    strikes and the dryness of the vegetation affected by global warming? Absolutely yes. Were they <br>
                    made significantly hotter, more numerous, and drier because of global warming? Yes, likely yes, <br>
                    and yes." Other than, a suspect named Ivan Geronimo Gomez has been charged by the <br> 
                    Monterey County Sheriff with arson relating to the Dolan Fire; however, this has not been <br>
                    officially determined as the cause of the fire. Arson has also been suspected as <br>
                    the cause of the Ranch 2 Fire in Los Angeles County.

                If you are ever out and about and notice a fire that is burning out of control or is unattended, immediately call 911 or your local fire department. <br> 
                When the conditions are right, even a small campfire can turn into a massive fire. .”See something? Say something,” is one of the key wildfire <br>

                Many people wonder how to prevent wildfires, but the easiest way is to be careful when having a campfire or using a fire pit. A fire should never <br>
                be left unattended for any period. Also, when you are done with the fire, then make sure you completely extinguish it. Use water or ashes to put <br>
                out the flames.

            <p style="display: flex;justify-content: center; padding-bottom: 5%;">
                Never throw lit cigarettes, smoking materials, or matches out of your car, or on the ground. Cigarettes and matches both have enough heat to create <br>
                a spark. Make sure any cigarettes are completely extinguished before you throw them in the trash. Many wildfires can start by carelessly flicking <br>
                a cigarette butt on the ground, especially during dangerously dry conditions.
