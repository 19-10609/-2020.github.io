        It changed our life styles, threatened every country's economy, and sickened <br> many people, some of whom ended up dead. <br><br>

                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a <br>
                newly discovered coronavirus. It was first identified in December <br>
                2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing <br>
                pandemic. No one knows the exact source of the current outbreak <br>
                of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but we know that it <br>
                originally came from an animal, likely a bat. Most people infected<br>
                with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory<br>
                illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people,<br>
                and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease,<br>
                diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely <br>
                to develop serious illness.

                    <b>Health</b><br>

        <p>What Can We do To Stop The Spread Of Covid-19?</p>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div style="padding:8% 0%; background-color:rgb(32, 32, 32); color:white; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; border-left: white solid 1px; border-right: white solid 2px;">
        <p><h1 style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 5%;">Things That You Can Do.</h1></p><br>
        <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding-bottom: 5%;">
            -Wash Your Hands<br><br>
            The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed (or exposing others) to this virus. First, practice simple hygiene. <br>
            Wash your hands regularly with soap and water for 20 seconds – especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, <br>
            and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. 
        </p>
        <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;padding-bottom: 5%;">
            -Wear a Mask and Avoid Crowds <br><br>
            Stay home as much as possible. Avoid close contact (at least 6 feet, or about two arms’ length) with people who are not <br> from
            your household, even if they don’t appear sick, in both indoor and outdoor spaces. Some people without symptoms <br>  may be able
            to spread the coronavirus. When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either <br> wash it 
            if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
        </p>
        <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;padding-bottom: 5%;">
            -Donate Blood  <br><br>
            Another way to help is to donate blood if you are able. Maintaining an adequate blood supply is vital to public health. <br>
            Blood donors help patients of all ages and kinds – accident and burn victims, heart surgery and organ transplant patients, <br>
            and those battling cancer and other life-threatening conditions.
        </p>
        <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center;padding-bottom: 5%;">
            -If You Have Fully Recovered From COVID-19, Donate Plasma  <br><br>
            People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 are encouraged to consider donating plasma, which could potentially <br> help save 
            the lives of other COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies (proteins that might help fight the <br> infection) in  their blood. 
            COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered individuals if they are <br> eligible to  donate blood. 
            COVID-19 convalescent plasma can be collected from individuals who have had a prior <br> diagnosis of COVID-19, which is  documented by a 
            laboratory test, and who meet other qualifications.
